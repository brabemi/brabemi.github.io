      <description>You may have noticed there is lot of noise about ARM vs x86. I would say mainly because of new mac books wit apple silicon. But if you are AWS user you may have noticed that Amazon has arm based EC2 instances for a while.
Motivation At the moment there is 2nd generation of AWS Graviton processors and available EC2 T4g, M6g, C6g, and R6g instances, and their variants with local NVMe-based SSD storage, that provide up to 40% better price performance over comparable current generation x86-based instances [1].</description>
